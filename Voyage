1) Text: "In a deployed application, there should be no need to close or reset the connection to the database"
I am not a native speaker but for me this words are to week.
We should stronlgy warn to do this/exactly explain what happens if someone does this and already has references in the image to some objects in the cache.
-> In this case, a new cache is created and the object in the old cache seems to be another one. If saving the object in the new cache, it is doubled.
Perhaps add some sentences explaining how the cache works. There have been some discussions about it in slack, mails and nabble about this.
It would be useful to summarize it/explain it. (I suffered a lot from it, took much time because I did not understand what VORepository current reset does)
