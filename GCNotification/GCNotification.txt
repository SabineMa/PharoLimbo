It is simple and here is an example:


Create a class:

  Object subclass: #Bar
	instanceVariableNames: 'id'
	classVariableNames: ''
	category: 'Foo'
	
implemented an #initialize method

  initialize
	super initialize.
	id := UUID new.	
	Transcript show: 'Initialized ', id printString; cr

and implemented a finalization method:

  finalize

	Transcript show: 'Finalized ', id printString; cr
	
Now in the workspace I instantiate the object:

   |anObject|
   Transcript open; clear.
   anObject := Bar new.
   Transcript flush.
   WeakRegistry default add: anObject.
   
and by forcing garbage collection in a second step I can 
see that the finalization method is working:

   3 timesRepeat: [ Smalltalk garbageCollect ].
   Transcript flush.
   

And I get the following output

  Initialized 4aa47ef1-0e4c-9a47-bddf-b406ee2042e4
  Finalized 4aa47ef1-0e4c-9a47-bddf-b406ee2042e4

If it doesnt work check your VM for updates.
